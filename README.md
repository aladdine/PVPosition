# PVPosition
This is an android app that tells whether a solar panel is placed correctly or not. Then it estimates how much energy is lost because of the mis-alignment of the solar panel. 

# Applications
- If the solar installer has several roofs to put the solar panels, this app helps them select which is best.
- This app helps installers decide whether they should put the panels directly on the roof, or they should add a frame to improve the panels position.
- This app can also be used to estimate losses due to mislaignment versus other types of losses.
