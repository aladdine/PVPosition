# PV Position
This is an android app that tells whether a solar panel is placed correctly or not. Then it estimates how much energy is lost because of the mis-alignment of the solar panel. 

Inputs: lat, lon, azimuth, tilt.
Outputs: % of energy produced vs the maximum energy that can be produced if the position was ideal, optimal tilt, optimal azimuth. 

# Applications
- If the solar installer has several roofs to put the solar panels, this app helps them select which is best.
- This app helps installers decide whether they should put the panels directly on the roof, or it is worth adding a frame to improve the panels position.
- This app can also be used to estimate losses due to mislaignment versus other types of losses. 
- This app can be used to determine the ideal azimuth and tilt for placing a solar panel.
