# PVPosition
This is an android app that tells whether a solar panel is placed correctly or not. Then it estimates how much energy is lost because of the mis-alignment of the solar panel. 

# Applications
- If the solar installer has several roofs to out the solar panels, this app helps them decide which is best.
- This app helps installers decide whether they should put the panels directly on the roof, or they should use a frame to improve the panels position.
- This app helps installers compare two installations side by side if they are not at the same position with respect to the sun.
